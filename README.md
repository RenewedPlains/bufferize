# Bufferize - Find and replace.
Requires WordPress. Search on your WordPress 
website for a specific text or HTML 
element and replace it with other content. 
Search, find and replace.

## How does the replacement work
When you activate the plugin in your WordPress 
website, a new post type is added. 
These new posts that can be created in the backend contain 
2 crucial values each: 
**Wanted** and **Replace with**. 
Wanted field is searched for in the displayed markup. 
If there is at least one occurrence, all found 
are completely replaced by the specification in the 
Replace with field.
